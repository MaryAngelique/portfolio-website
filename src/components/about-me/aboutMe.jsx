                    I am Angelique and I am Software Engineer that studied and graduated as a FullStack Web Developer from BloomTech, coding bootcamp in a remote environment.

                    I grew up with technology and as someone who was born and raised in a third world country, technology is a limited resource. I was fortunate enough that my grandmother works in the municipal office, which made technology accessible for me. 
                    
                    I chose this career field to help and develop websites that are accessible. One day, I would like to build a website of a library that is full of educational resources for teachers and students to help the future generations equipped with knowledge and resources they need right on their finger tips. I also want to pursue my passion in design by creating websites that are aesthetic to see and also accessible for a wide range of users.
